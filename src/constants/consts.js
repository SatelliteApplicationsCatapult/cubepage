      NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index)​ = (NIR - red) / (NIR + red)

      (NDWI takes advantage of green and near infrared bands to highlight water bodies.  This index responds in a similar way to built-up areas as it does to water, so can over-estimate water-bodies in these areas.  Values range from -1 to 1, values greater than 0.5 usually correspond to water bodies, with built-up areas between 0 and 0.2, and vegetation much smaller values)

      (L is a correction for canopy background. C1 and C2 are values to adjust for atmospheric resistance.  Although ideally these should be set on a per scene basis, these are set at 1 and 6 and 7.5 relatively for this product.  EVI is similar to the NDVI and can also be used to quantify vegetation greenness.  However, EVI corrects for some atmospheric conditions and canopy background noise and is more sensitive in areas with dense vegetation.  The range of  EVI values do go below -1 and 1, though most values are between these numbers, with healthy vegetation generally around 0.20 to 0.80. Higher values indicate denser vegetation)
      
      NDDI (Normalised Difference Drought Index) = (NDVI - NDWI) / (NDVI+NDWI)

      (This index uses two of the other indices in this product namely NDWI and NDVI.  This index was developed by Gu et al (20017) to address drought, as the index takes advantage of NDVI's ability to detect planet matter and NDWI sensing plant moisture.  NDDI values range between -1 and 1 with higher values representing drier conditions, and so more likely drought)

      text: `
      This product uses vegetation indices to identify changes in vegetation cover, with a choice of indices to use.  An option to place a threshold to filter the type of vegetation change identified is also offered. 
      
      Indices types are NDVI or EVI, both of which provide information on vegetation cover. 
      
      NDVI is the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) = (NIR – RED)/(NIR + Red) 
      
      (NDVI tells us how vegetated a surface is, for each pixel the value ranges from minus one (-1) to plus one (+1); a surface with non-green vegetation would give you a value close to zero, whilst values closer to +1 indicate the highest density of green vegetation)
      
      EVI is the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) = Green ((NIR - Red) / (NIR + C1 Red – C2 * Blue + L))   
      
      (L is a correction for canopy background.  C1 and C2 are values to adjust for atmospheric resistance. Although ideally these should be set on a per scene basis, these are set at ? and ? and ? for this product. 
      
      EVI is similar to NDVI and can also be used to quantify vegetation greenness. However, EVI corrects for some atmospheric conditions and canopy background noise and is more sensitive in areas with dense vegetation.
      
      Both of these indices are slightly different but work in the same way, to determine the vegetation state. Users should test both to determine which is more appropriate for their area of interest.
      
      The workflow followed by the Data Cube to produce this product is provided in the diagram below. `,
